# Unity for .Net Core 2.0

The Unity Container (Unity) is a lightweight, extensible dependency injection container. It facilitates building loosely coupled applications and provides developers with the following advantages:

* Simplified object creation, especially for hierarchical object structures and dependencies
* Abstraction of requirements; this allows developers to specify dependencies at run time or in configuration and simplify management of crosscutting concerns
* Increased flexibility by deferring component configuration to the container
* Service location capability; this allows clients to store or cache the container
* Instance and type interception
* Registration by convention

# Unity Interception for .Net Core 2.0

Unity interception enables you to effectively capture calls to objects and add additional functionality to the target object. Interception is useful when you want to modify the behavior for individual objects but not the entire class, very much as you would do when using the Decorator pattern. It provides a flexible approach for adding new behaviors to an object at run time.
